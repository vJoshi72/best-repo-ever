To check your storage usage in Salesforce, follow these steps:

Navigate to Setup: Click on the gear icon in the top right corner and select "Setup."

Quick Find Box: In the Quick Find box on the left, type "Storage Usage."

Storage Usage Page: Click on "Storage Usage" from the search results.

On the Storage Usage page, you'll see a breakdown of your current storage limits, the storage used, and the percentage of your storage limit that has been used. The page provides detailed tables showing the components that make up your storage usage, such as data storage and file storage2.

If you need more detailed information, you can refer to the Salesforce Help Docs or Roycon's guide.
